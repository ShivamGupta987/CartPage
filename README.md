# Cart Page with Vite, React, and Redux

This project implements a dynamic and responsive cart page for an eCommerce platform, leveraging the power of Vite for fast development setup, React for building the user interface, and Redux for managing the application's state. The cart page allows users to view items they have added, adjust quantities, remove items, and see the total cost dynamically.

## Features

- **View Cart Items**: Users can see all items they've added to their cart.
- **Adjust Item Quantities**: Users can increase or decrease the quantity of each item in their cart.
- **Remove Items**: Items can be removed from the cart.
- **Dynamic Total Calculation**: The total cost updates as items are added, removed, or quantities are changed.
- **Responsive Design**: The cart page is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
